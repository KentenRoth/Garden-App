# Garden-App

The garden app will help you keep track of when your plants are coming up on their estimated harvest time.  When you start planting seeds in your garden, you can input what you planted and the estimated days until harvest.  The app will have a count down to when you should be keeping an eye on your plants.

This project is built with JavaScript and saves everything to local storage.  The reason I created this app was to help me keep track of when some plants should be harvestable.  Most of my garden I have a rough idea of when to start pulling plants, but there have been occasions I forgot or during long stretches of rain in the evenings I was not checking my plants nearly as often.

For the future of this project, I hope to convert it to React, and also build out the backend with either MongoDB or take that time to learn SQL.  Currently, with it saving to local storage, it does not have the capabilities to be as mobile an accessible as I want.
